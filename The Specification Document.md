# The Specification Document
*Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (CS) / Python*

### What programming language are you using?
I will use Python to carry out my project, because it seems to me to be the best option for making a project of this complexity from scratch.
I still have knowledge of Java, most web languages, C and R for peer review.

### What algorithms and data structures are you implementing in your work?
For this work I will then implement a multilayer Perceptron algorithm. For the implementation of this algorithm I will need array, matrix, vectors and maybe dictionary. To access the elements presented above I will use the python module numpy and maybe math.
For classification, training and testing of my algorithm I will need labeled data for classification. Test and training data for the operation of the algorithm.

### What problem are you solving?
This algorithm allows to determine if with given variables if the passenger survived or not. From the following variables: The Pclass which determines if the passenger's class is between 3 (1 being first class), the age, the number of siblings or spouses on board, the number of parents/children on board, the price of the ticket and the port embarked.

### What inputs does your program take, and how are these used?
As input data I have the different sizes of petals and sepals. We can also enter the colors, the locations, if they are foraged, etc. Once the data is entered they pass through the different layers of the neural network and apply the weights related to the different characteristics.

### The desired time and space complexities
The space complexity of an MLP is determined by the number of weights and biases that need to be stored. The complexities will be determined by the number of layers and the number of neurons per layer needed to process and calculate the algorithm.
