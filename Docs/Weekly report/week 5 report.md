# 5st Weekly report :
*8 hours*

## Create the main
For this week, I created my main, linking the interface, the MLP model and the mathematical functions. The main therefore launches an interface with the model in parallel allowing to enter data in inputs to test them *(remains to be finished due to a change in the target variable)*.

## Peer review
I wrote the peer review on another student's code, with the topic of digit recognition via a KNN algorithm.

## Solve problems
I had to solve many problems, especially modular ones, for the linking of the different scripts between them.
I changed the target variable of the model in order to have a more "useful" model.

So I created a file for the preparation of the data and their tests in order to make the use of the latter by the interface more readable.

## Create the interface
So I created the interface with all the methods useful for its operation and for those linked to the MLP methods, data preparation and mathematical functions.

## For the next week 
For the last week I will finish solving the last issues, writing the ReadME and the last necessary documents.
I will also keep cleaning up my project to make it more presentable and translate the last comments.
