# 1st Weekly report :
### Introduction 
As part of the Datastructure and IA Lab course, I have to create an algorithm from Scratch to solve a problem.
Here is the progress of the project after 6 hours of work for the first week.

### First task 
To begin with, following the first Datastructure and IA lab course, I created the GIT repository and carried out the various manipulations to be done on it.

Once the repository was created, I saved it to LabTools.
After thinking about the list of topics for a long time I decided to use a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm to predict what type of plant it is by entering tabular data.

### Project idea 
I chose this subject because I already have a foundation in machine learning and deep learning. Indeed, in France I already had theoretical courses on how these work.
Before choosing the current topic, I had started with a CNN (Convolutional neural network) algorithm for image recognition and labeling.

My first research therefore focused on this subject. I read scientific journals on different cases of implementation of this algorithm in everyday life, looking at how people implement this algorithm from scratch or even the internal and theoretical functioning in detail of this algorithm.

It was after researching the decomposition of images with many details into different matrices to study them that I realized that the subject was probably beyond my means. 

Indeed, the implementation of a neural network is already a more than complex task. Preprocessing the data to make them usable and extract the desired information makes the task too complex.
I then decided to use a simpler algorithm to implement: MLP and less restrictive data to work with, tabular data.

### Specification document
I wrote the “Specification Document”, indicating the languages I know, a brief presentation of my project and the elements necessary for calculating the complexity of my algorithm both in terms of time and space.

## My search about the MLP :
I found that among all the languages, the most practical to use in order to realize an algorithm using neural networks is Python. Moreover, having already solid bases in Python.
So I learned about the various essential points of the MLP.

### Forward Propagation
Such as the different layers of the model: the input layer (where the data is entered to be processed), the most important layer called hidden (can be composed of several sub-layers of neurons with different weights depending on the needs) and finally the output layer (the one from which the result comes out once the data has been processed).

The model works in 2 parts: Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation.

### Backward Propagation
During training, it is the difference between the given output and the expected output that allows the weight of the neurons in the previous layers to be readjusted to improve the model.

### Labeled data
I searched for different labeled datasets for testing and training. Ex: The Iris dataset.

### Source 
As a source of research for my information I used videos, scientific articles on uses of this algorithm in the past and online courses on the theory and implementation of an MLP algorithm.

The most complex task of this work will be the implementation of neural systems. To achieve this from scratch, I will need to use the Numpy library and maybe math which will allow me to use mathematical structures such as vectors or matrices in a more practical way.

## What’s next 
For the next times, I think I will continue researching MLP and how to implement it.
I would also like to start coding and thinking about tests and a dataset for the model.
I would like to have a start of a neural system for next week.
